Private repository permissions in Github for auto-assign to work appropriately:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If a repository is private, this **could very well be the cause of the 404 "Not Found" error.**

Here's why:

1.  **Private Repositories Require Repository-Level Permissions:** Accessing *any* resource inside a private repository (code, issues, pull requests, commits, etc.) requires authentication with a token that has permissions specifically for *that repository*.
2.  **`read:org` is Not a Repository Scope:** The `read:org` scope you added to your PAT is for reading information *about the organization* itself (teams, members list, etc.). It **does not** automatically grant permission to read data *within* private repositories owned by that organization.
3.  **404 Can Mean "Not Found DUE TO LACK OF PERMISSIONS":** The GitHub API often returns a 404 "Not Found" error not just when a resource literally doesn't exist, but also when the authenticated user or token **does not have permission to see that resource or the repository containing it**. From the token's perspective, if it can't access the repository, the issue inside it is effectively "Not Found".
4.  **The Action is Making a Repository-Level API Call:** The error message shows the action is calling `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{issue_number}`, which is a repository-level API endpoint.

**Conclusion:**

For a private repository, your Personal Access Token likely needs **additional scopes** beyond just `read:org` to be able to read issues within it.

For a classic PAT, you would typically need the `repo` scope, which grants full control over private repositories (including reading issues). If you want more fine-grained control, you'd use a fine-grained PAT and grant "Read" permissions specifically for "Issues" and potentially other necessary repository-level permissions for that repository.

**Action to take:**

1.  Go back to your Personal Access Token settings on GitHub.
2.  **Check the scopes** granted to the PAT you created for the auto-assign action.
3.  If the repository is private, ensure the PAT has a scope that grants read access to its contents. For a classic PAT, checking the `repo` scope is the broadest way, but granting more specific "Repository permissions" like "Issues" (Read) is preferable if using a fine-grained token.
4.  Update the PAT with the necessary repository scope, regenerate it, update the secret in your repository settings with the new token value, and re-run the workflow.

Adding the correct repository-level read permission is necessary for the action to even *see* issue number 43 if it's in a private repository.
